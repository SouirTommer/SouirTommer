## Hi, I'm Tommer ðŸ‘‹

Programming is about unlocking solutions, not just showcasing skills. In todayâ€™s AI-driven world, problem-solving ability is more valuable than the number of languages or frameworks you know.

I code to create value and address real-world challenges. Even quick solutions matter as long as they work. Ultimately, itâ€™s your problem-solving skills that leave a lasting impact, not the tools you use.
