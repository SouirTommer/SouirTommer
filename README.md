## Hi, I'm Tommer 👋

For me, programming isn’t just about showing off skills—it’s a key to unlocking solutions. The tool itself isn’t what matters most; what truly counts is whether you can use it to open the door to the answer.

In this era of AI, the ability to solve problems efficiently and creatively is far more important than how many languages you know or which frameworks you use.

That’s why I don’t code just for the sake of coding. I code to create value and to solve real-world problems. Even if the solution is a “quick and dirty” one, I’m proud as long as it gets the job done—because in the end, it’s your problem-solving ability that will be remembered, not the number of tools you’ve used.

Let's code for impact, not just for code!
